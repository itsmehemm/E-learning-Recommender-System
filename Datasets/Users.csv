<p>I've been using computers since I was 4, which is now more than 30 years. When I think about this it makes me feel old. I love rollercoasters, big band jazz and movies.</p>

<p>I primarily write web software using Ruby on Rails, but recently started writing iPad applications in Objective C. I spent an awful lot of time using Delphi, and now pretty much only maintain things in it.</p>
